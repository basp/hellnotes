# Notes
* The password for my 108 dragon hideout near Botany Bay is "three-way" but it's different for each character and playthrough.

# General
* The `@buffs` command is freaking amazing. Use it.
* The `@paste` command is useful if you wanna paste multiple lines of text. You need to have decent brains in order to use this.

# Sonic scalpels
These very useful blades are not pretty decent weapons thanks to their ability to cut through armor and cause bleeding. They also are an excellent way to grind up medic if you don't want or can't do the `massage` thing. The problem with these scalpels is that they are not that easy to obtain. You might be able to buy one from Rough Trade in Slagtown (they cost $9,000).

# Zombie
* It's easy to make money by camping the lobstros underwater once you can handle them well enough. This also means you don't have to worry about running into Mr. Bungle at the boardwalk.
* You can still custom `emote` as a zombie if you get your brains up to 6. This will also get rid of the zombie filter.

# Cluster Fuck & Cluster Hunt
There's these green glyphs around Necropolis. If you search around at those locations you'll find a sensor which you can download data from. Do this ten times to complete the jobs. They run simultaneously and payout pretty decently.

# Weezer Feeder
Hogarth is located at the Albumen Cafe in Weezer. The Collective would appreciate it if you sold him white rolls, bacon and pork chops. You can buy this food from Luskentyre or just cook it up or have someone else cook it up for you.

# Office Worker
Remember WUUT, and Heaven... Those answers are important. The rest of the answers should more or less be obvious.

# Shoggoth Lair
You can enter from underwater, much safer than going through the furnace. Go to she south shoreline and go down below the surface and find below the well in the pipe to the west. It's near Rapture. Find the altar room and there will be 3 stones to the north, south and east. Turn the north, south and east stones to 6, 6 and 5 respectively. Go back to the altar room and jump down. The lair is all the way in the north west and the exit is to the south.
