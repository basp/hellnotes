# Chromemouth/brainy blades
The main ability of chromemouth is the `zero` command which can be used to heal yourself by a percentage of de damage you dealt in combat. The success of this command based on cool which should synergize well with a blades build.

Chromemouth gives a +3 boost to endurance as well as some useful bonusses to craft and scavenge. A bit of endurance can never hurt as it is used in a lot of useful skills like swimming and climbing for example. The craft and scavenge bonusses fit well with the overal goal for this character.

Ideally you'll be slicing things with blades or preferably dual wielded knives. With awesome scavenging skills you can find your own materials which you then can use to craft things with. Thanks to reasonably high endurance you'll also be able to swim and climb well so getting around shouldn't be a huge problem until you learn to fly a plane (or alternatively get flight).

Your focus and senses will not be great, so any mutations that heavily depend on those stats are probably out.

## Character creation
### Tags
* Blades
* Craft
* Scavenge
* Science

### Stats
* 14 Cool
* 14 Reflex
* 10 Brains

## Mutations
### Mandatory
* **Chromemouth**: no surprise.
* **Swollen brain**: offsets the -1 to brains from chromemouth.
* **Twitchy nerves**: extra reflex is useful for all aspects of this build.
* **Nimble fingers**: even more reflex at the expensive of some endurance.
* **Fuck machine**: offsets the -1 to cool from swollen brains (so reflex and cool end up both as even numbers).

### Good
* **Hyperimmune**: good choice for most builds.
* **Iron liver**: why not.
* **Fibrocartilage**: extra health but rejuvex will be nigh unusable.
* **Mule**: since you're not that brawny you might want this to actually carry stuff around.
* **Supercloth**: helps with the bleeding.

### Maybe
* **Bloodhound**: extra tracking and offsets the negatives to senses from other mutations.
* **Enigma**: +2 cool but with serious drawbacks and also -1 to senses.
* **Brute strength**: you don't really need the brawn but it might be useful if only to carry more stuff. You can probably spare the endurance.
* **Stench**: might be useful if you have trouble with mobs aggroing you.
* **Flight**: could be an option if you don't like planes. Consider **yeti skin** and **yeti fur** if you're gonna take this as well as **stench**.

## Probably not
* **Billygoat**: if you need more endurance and/or climb or if you just wanna `munch` things.
* **Salamander**: if you really find yourself needing the climb and swim boosts and don't mind the -1 to craft, `mend` will probably be useless though.

### Nope
* **Clair**: could've been fun and useful for some more creative builds. Not anymore since the night vision was nerfed.

### Soaks
* **High density**: seems legit for most builds
* **Rubberskin**
* **Firewalker**

If you go for flight, consider **yeti skin** and **yeti fur** with **firewalker** instead. However, you are brainy so you could fly a plane as well.

## Weapons
* Switchknife, cutting knife, butcher knife (1-3): buy from ammu-nation
* Katana (3-5): on various mobs such as in the mines or at Kakuri
* Wasteland kukri (5-8): craft this or have it crafted
* Hosaka Daikatana (6-8): scales better with skill than the kukri
* Chobo knife (8-*): probably your end game weapon, can only be bought by chuds

Remember, you probably don't have super brawn so you're probably better off trying to be quick stabber than a heavy hitter.

## Armor
* Basic set of 3x leather jacker, 3x leather pants, 3x rusted pot, 2x lacrosse gloves, combat boots, gas mask and 2x hockey mask should work in the beginning.
* A tire armor might be a good choice for some mobs when your dodge is still low.
* If you're dodgy enough you might try dodge gear such as 4x karate gi and all-stars.
